Where would you avoid JavaScript?
If CSS can handle it - don't use JS
For instance, hover events or focus events
Animations - CSS handles this 
Advanced Animation - CSS and JS together 
HTML5 can do it better - range control, sliders - mobile platforms
Wired to custom keyboards suited for types of emails or phone numbers

What are the potential pitfalls of using JavaScript?
Security risks (XSS)
Image tags, object tags, inject JS into the site to load data
Cross-site script attacks - inject JS that is not part of the site into visitors' browsers - the website can be defaced, site visitors' personal info being revealed or stolen

Performance issues 
Pull and display ads
Tracking scripts 
Large file sizes
Long page load times
Keep jS lean 
Avoid using lots of scripts 

The result of these issues is JS can be blocked
Sometimes entirely often partially
Content blockers on mobile and desktop browsers can try to block ads and tracking scripts from ever loading and some take more aggressive steps to try to protect user privacy 
Institutional firewalls may block some or all of your JS and some users may opt-out and disable JS as a feature of their browsers
